	abstract = {Knowledge workers expend considerable effort managing fragmentation, characterized by constant switching among digital artifacts, when executing work activities. Activity-centric computing ({ACC}) systems attempt to address this problem by organizing activity-related artifacts together. But are {ACC} systems effective at reducing fragmentation? In this paper, we present a two-part study of workers using Lotus Activities, an {ACC} system deployed for over two years in a large company. First, we surveyed workers to understand the ecology of workplace tools they use for various tasks. Second, we interviewed 22 Lotus Activities users to investigate how this {ACC} tool fits amongst their ecology of existing collaboration tools and affects work fragmentation. Our results indicate that Lotus Activities works in concert with certain other tools to successfully ease fragmentation for a specific type of activity. We identify design characteristics that contribute to this result.},

In this paper, we identify and address the vital and largely unexamined problem of how to structure implementations of cryptographic protocols to protect sensitive data despite exploits. As evidence that this problem is poorly understood, we first identify two attacks that lead to disclosure of sensitive data in two published state-of-the-art designs for exploit-resistant cryptographic protocol implementations: privilege-separated {OpenSSH}, and the {HiStar}/{DStar} {DIFC}-based {SSL} web server. We then describe how to structure protocol implementations on {UNIX}- and {DIFC}-based systems to defend against these two attacks and protect sensitive information from disclosure. We demonstrate the practicality and generality of this approach by applying it to protect sensitive data in the implementations of both the server and client sides of {OpenSSH} and of the {OpenSSL} library.},

The scenario we introduce shows that it is no longer feasible to argue that users must be educated in order to correctly operate these systems. As soon as such a system is deployed, for example, in a supermarket, the education-barrier will not be accepted: neither by the customer nor by the provider.},

	abstract = {Users today are unable to use the rich collection of third-party untrusted applications without risking significant privacy leaks. In this paper, we argue that current and proposed applications and data-centric security policies do not map well to users' expectations of privacy. In the eyes of a user, applications and peripheral devices exist merely to provide functionality and should have no place in controlling privacy. Moreover, most users cannot handle intricate security policies dealing with system concepts such as labeling of data, application permissions and virtual machines. Not only are current policies impenetrable to most users, they also lead to security problems such as privilege-escalation attacks and implicit information leaks. Our key insight is that users naturally associate data with real-world events, and want to control access at the level of human contacts. We introduce Bubbles, a context-centric security system that explicitly captures user's privacy desires by allowing human contact lists to control access to data clustered by real-world events. Bubbles infers information-flow rules from these simple context-centric access-control rules to enable secure use of untrusted applications on users' data. We also introduce a new programming model for untrusted applications that allows them to be functional while still upholding the users' privacy policies. We evaluate the model's usability by porting an existing medical application and writing a calendar app from scratch. Finally, we show the design of our system prototype running on Android that uses bubbles to automatically infer all dangerous permissions without any user intervention. Bubbles prevents Android-style permission escalation attacks without requiring users to specify complex information flow rules.},

The question then shifts from debates over the status of human-like machines, to that of how humans and machines are enacted as similar or different in practice, and with what theoretical, practical and political consequences. Drawing on scholarship across the social sciences, humanities and computing, the author argues for research aimed at tracing the differences within specific sociomaterial arrangements without resorting to essentialist divides. This requires expanding our unit of analysis, while recognizing the inevitable cuts or boundaries through which technological systems are constituted.},

To begin with, the nascent field of {HCI} followed the scientific method borrowing theories from cognitive science to test theories about user performance at the interface. But {HCI} has emerged as an eclectic interdiscipline rather than a well-defined science. It now covers all aspects of human life, from birth to bereavement, through all manner of computing, from device ecologies to nano-technology. It comes as no surprise that the role of theory in {HCI} has also greatly expanded from the early days of scientific testing to include other functions such as describing, explaining, critiquing, and as the basis for generating new designs.The book charts the theoretical developments in {HCI}, both past and present, reflecting on how they have shaped the field. It explores both the rhetoric and the reality: how theories have been conceptualized, what was promised, how they have been used and which has made the most impact in the field -- and the reasons for this. Finally, it looks to the future and asks whether theory will continue to have a role, and, if so, what this might be.},

When approaching security and interaction design from an experience approach, tools that help bring out such relevant experiences for design are needed.

We discuss how these tools helped the design process and illustrate how the tangibility of such tools matters. We further demonstrate how the approach grants access to non-trivial insights into people's security experience. We point out how the specific context is essential for exploring the space between experience and expectations, and we illustrate how people activate their collections of security experiences rather than deploying one security strategy in all situations.},

This would enable any developer to inject a new service into third-party Internet infrastructure; for example, dynamic content generation code could be introduced into content-delivery networks or caching systems. We believe that virtual machine monitors ({VMMs}) are ideally suited to this application domain. A {VMM} provides strong isolation by default, since one virtual machine cannot directly name a resource in another. In addition, {VMMs} defer the implementation of high-level abstractions to guest {OSs}, which greatly simplifies the kernel and avoids "layer-below" attacks. The main challenge in using a {VMM} for this application domain is in scaling the number of concurrent virtual machines that can simultaneously execute on it.},

To determine possible causes of {SSL} problems on all major appified platforms, we extended the analysis to the walled-garden ecosystem of {iOS}, analyzed software developer forums and conducted interviews with developers of vulnerable apps. Our results show that the root causes are not simply careless developers, but also limitations and issues of the current {SSL} development paradigm. Based on our findings, we derive a proposal to rethink the handling of {SSL} in the appified world and present a set of countermeasures to improve the handling of {SSL} using Android as a blueprint for other platforms. Our countermeasures prevent developers from willfully or accidentally breaking {SSL} certificate validation, offer support for extended features such as {SSL} Pinning and different {SSL} validation infrastructures, and protect users. We evaluated our solution against 13,500 popular Android apps and conducted developer interviews to judge the acceptance of our approach and found that our solution works well for all investigated apps and developers.},

We implemented {DAGGER}, a keylogger that attacks Linux and Windows platforms. Our evaluation confirms that {DMA} malware can efficiently attack kernel structures even if memory address randomization is in place. {DMA} malware is stealthy to a point where the host cannot detect its presense.

These themes provide a set of sensitivities or orientations that may complement traditional task-based approaches to evaluation as well as the more open-ended ones we describe here. Our system showed symptoms of failure under each of these themes. We examine the reasons for this at three levels: problems particular to the specific design hypothesis; problems relevant for input-output mapping more generally; and problems in the design process we used. We conclude by noting that, although interpretive systems such as the one we describe here may succeed in a myriad of different ways, it is reassuring to know that they can also fail, and fail incontrovertibly, yet instructively.},

At a time when many {IT} and security professionals are still worrying about the latest e-mail virus or how to get all of this month's security patches installed, Mr. Hoglund and Mr. Butler open your eyes to some of the most stealthy and significant threats to the Windows operating system. Only by understanding these offensive techniques can you properly defend the networks and systems for which you are responsible.""--Jennifer Kolde, Security Consultant, Author, and Instructor""What's worse than being owned? Not knowing it. Find out what it means to be owned by reading Hoglund and Butler's first-of-a-kind book on rootkits. At the apex the malicious hacker toolset--which includes decompilers, disassemblers, fault-injection engines, kernel debuggers, payload collections, coverage tools, and flow analysis tools--is the rootkit. Beginning where Exploiting Software left off, this book shows how attackers hide in plain sight. "Rootkits are extremely powerful and are the next wave of attack technology. Like other types of malicious code, rootkits thrive on stealthiness. They hide away from standard system observers, employing hooks, trampolines, and patches to get their work done. Sophisticated rootkits run in such a way that other programs that usually monitor machine behavior can't easily detect them. A rootkit thus provides insider access only to people who know that it is running and available to accept commands. Kernel rootkits can hide files and running processes to provide a backdoor into the target machine. "Understanding the ultimate attacker's tool provides an important motivator for those of us trying to defend systems. No authors are better suited to give you a detailed hands-on understanding of rootkits than Hoglund and Butler. Better to own this book than to be owned.""--Gary {McGraw}, Ph.D., {CTO}, Cigital, coauthor of" Exploiting Software "(2004) and" Building Secure Software "(2002), both from Addison-Wesley""Greg and Jamie are unquestionably the go-to experts when it comes to subverting the Windows {API} and creating rootkits. These two masters come together to pierce the veil of mystery surrounding rootkits, bringing this information out of the shadows. Anyone even remotely interested in security for Windows systems, including forensic analysis, should include this book very high on their must-read list.""--Harlan Carvey, author of" Windows Forensics and Incident Recovery "(Addison-Wesley, 2005)"Rootkits are the ultimate backdoor, giving hackers ongoing and virtually undetectable access to the systems they exploit. Now, two of the world's leading experts have written the first comprehensive guide to rootkits: what they are, how they work, how to build them, and how to detect them. Rootkit.com's Greg Hoglund and James Butler created and teach Black Hat's legendary course in rootkits. In this book, they reveal never-before-told offensive aspects of rootkit technology--learn how attackers can get in and stay in for years, without detection. Hoglund and Butler show exactly how to subvert the Windows {XP} and Windows 2000 kernels, teaching concepts that are easily applied to virtually any modern operating system, from Windows Server 2003 to Linux and {UNIX}. Using extensive downloadable examples, they teach rootkit programming techniques that can be used for a wide range of software, from white hat security tools to operating system drivers and debuggers.After reading this book, readers will be able {toUnderstand} the role of rootkits in remote command/control and software {eavesdroppingBuild} kernel rootkits that can make processes, files, and directories {invisibleMaster} key rootkit programming techniques, including hooking, runtime patching, and directly manipulating kernel {objectsWork} with layered drivers to implement keyboard sniffers and file {filtersDetect} rootkits and build host-based intrusion prevention software that resists rootkit {attacksVisit} rootkit.com for code and programs from this book.

Since users only have to memorise one master secret to unlock an encrypted password database or key chain storing all their (hopefully) different and strong passwords, password managers are intended to increase username/password security. With mobile Internet usage on the rise, password managers have found their way onto smartphones and tablets. In this paper, we analyse the security of password managers on Android devices. While encryption mechanisms are used to protect credentials, we will show that a usability feature of the investigated mobile password managers puts the users’ usernames and passwords at risk. We demonstrate the consequences of our findings by analysing 21 popular free and paid password managers for Android. We then make recommendations how to overcome the current problems and provide an implementation of a secure and usable mobile password manager.},

Most researchers who conduct password user studies try to address the issue in their study design. However, the methods researchers use to try to improve ecological validity vary and some methods even contradict each other. One reason for this is that the very nature of the problem of ecological validity of password studies is hard to study, due to the lack of ground truth. In this paper, we present a study on the ecological validity of password studies designed specifically to shed light on this issue. We were able to compare the behavior of 645 study participants with their real world password choices. We conducted both online and laboratory studies, under priming and non-priming conditions, to be able to evaluate the effects of these different forms of password studies. While our study is able to investigate only one specific password environment used by a limited population and thus cannot answer all questions about ecological validity, it does represent a first important step in judging the impact of ecological validity on password studies.},

	title = {Understanding Strategic Adaptation in Dual-Task Situations as Cognitively Bounded Rational Behavior},
	url = {http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1348372/},
	abstract = {In this thesis I explored when people interleave attention in dual-task settings. The hypothesis is that people try to perform in a cognitively bounded rational way. Performance is limited by constraints that come from the task environment and cognition. If, given these constraints, multiple strategies for interleaving tasks are available, then people will interleave tasks in a way that aligns with their local priority objective (Chapter 3), or which maximizes the value of an objective payoff function that evaluates performance (Chapter 4). This hypothesis was tested using a combination of experimental studies and computational cognitive models. Across a series of studies, the interplay between different constraints was investigated. In Chapters 5 and 6, I developed mathematical models to study what task combinations in general allowed for “ideal payoff manipulations” to study task interleaving. The work contributed to the existing literature in four ways: (1) it provided an overarching theory of skilled human dual-task performance and tested this in relatively applied settings, (2) the theory was formalized in computational cognitive models that can predict performance of unobserved strategies and that can bracket the (optimal) performance space, (3) linear and logarithmic tasks were identified as an ideal combination for achieving ideal payoff manipulations, and (4) results demonstrated that in multitasking situations attention is not necessarily interleaved solely at chunk boundaries and other “natural breakpoints”, but that this depends on a person’s priorities. The work has implications for driver distraction research, in that it helps in systematically understanding the performance trade-offs that people face when multitasking. Moreover, the modeling framework could be used for model-based evaluation of new mobile interfaces. Finally, the demonstration that priorities can strongly influence multitasking performance highlights the importance of public safety campaigns that emphasize awareness of driver safety. Limitations and further implications are discussed.},

We deployed {TAGtivity} and studied users' tagging practices in their actual work places over a three week period. Our analysis of interviews and logs reveals that affordances of the {TAGtivity} system supported users in a variety of information and activity management tasks. These include new practices for managing emerging activities and ephemeral information and accessing documents across application data silos.},

People accommodate and take advantage of seams and heterogeneity, in and through the process of interaction.

We critique the 'disappearance' mentioned by Weiser as a goal for ubicomp, and Dourish's 'embodied interaction' approach to {HCI}, suggesting that these design ideals may be unachievable or incomplete because they underemphasise the interdependence of 'invisible' non-rationalising interaction and focused rationalising interaction within ongoing activity.},

We provide a probabilistic framework for dynamically selecting an active authentication scheme that satisfies a specified security requirement given passive factors. We also present the results of three user studies evaluating the feasibility and users' receptiveness of our concept. Our results suggest that location data has good potential as a passive factor, and that users can reduce up to 68\% of active authentications when using an implementation of {CASA}, compared to always using fixed active authentication. Furthermore, our participants, including those who do not using any security mechanisms on their phones, were very positive about {CASA} and amenable to using it on their phones.},

	abstract = {It is commonly believed that the widespread use of Information and Communication Technologies ({ICTs}) facilitates the fragmentation of daily activities across times and spaces. However, a clear conceptualisation of what fragmentation is and how it can be measured empirically has been lacking. As a consequence, hardly any empirical evidence has been provided for these notions. The goal of this paper is twofold: (1) to propose a theoretical and methodological framework for identifying and measuring activity fragmentation; and (2) to assess temporal fragmentation empirically and consider its associations with {ICT} usage while controlling for sociodemographic variables, residential context, day of the week, activity pattern characteristics and some attitudinal variables. Activity fragmentation is defined as a process whereby a certain activity is divided into several smaller pieces, which are performed at different times and/or locations. The proposed theoretical and methodological framework covers three main dimensions of fragmentation: the number of fragments; the distribution of the sizes of fragments; and the temporal configuration of fragments. Based on travel diary data from the Netherlands the analytical results are insightful and promising. The framework is not only capable of detecting temporal activity fragmentation for various trip purposes, but there are also indications of a positive relation between {ICT} usage and temporal fragmentation.},

	abstract = {First published in 1895: Emile Durkheim’s masterful work on the nature and scope of sociology—now with a new introduction and improved translation by leading scholar Steven Lukes. The Rules of the Sociological Method is among the most important contributions to the field of sociology, still debated among scholars today. Through letters, arguments, and commentaries on significant debates, Durkheim confronted critics, clarified his own position, and defended the objective scientific method he applied to his study of humans. This updated edition offers an introduction and extra notes as well as a new translation to improve the clarity and accessibility of this essential work. In the introduction, Steven Lukes, author of the definitive biography Emile Durkheim: His Life and Work, spells out Durkheim’s intentions, shows the limits of Durkheim’s view of sociology, and presents its political background and significance. Making use of the various texts in this volume and Durkheim’s later work, Lukes discusses how Durkheim’s methodology was modified or disregarded in practice—and how it is still relevant today. With substantial notes on context, this user-friendly edition will greatly ease the task of students and scholars working with Durkheim’s method—a view that has been a focal point of sociology since its original publication. The Rules of the Sociological Method will engage a new generation of readers with Durkheim’s rich contribution to the field.},

	abstract = {It is often suggested that users are hopelessly lazy and unmotivated on security questions. They chose weak passwords, ignore security warnings, and are oblivious to certificates errors. We argue that users’ rejection of the security advice they receive is entirely rational from an economic perspective. The advice offers to shield them from the direct costs of attacks, but burdens them with far greater indirect costs in the form of effort. Looking at various examples of security advice we find that the advice is complex and growing, but the benefit is largely speculative or moot. For example, much of the advice concerning passwords is outdated and does little to address actual threats, and fully 100\% of certificate error warnings appear to be false positives. Further, if users spent even a minute a day reading {URLs} to avoid phishing, the cost (in terms of user time) would be two orders of magnitude greater than all phishing losses. Thus we find that most security advice simply offers a poor cost-benefit tradeoff to users and is rejected. Se- curity advice is a daily burden, applied to the whole population, while an upper bound on the benefit is the harm suffered by the fraction that become victims an- nually. When that fraction is small, designing security advice that is beneficial is very hard. For example, it makes little sense to burden all users with a daily task to spare 0.01\% of them a modest annual pain.},

Over the past several years, the computer security community has been developing automated tools to analyze computer system audit data for suspicious user behavior. This paper describes the use of such tools for detecting computer system intrusion and describes further technologies that may be of use for intrusion detection in the future.},

	shorttitle = {Reassembling the Social},
	abstract = {Reassembling the Social is a fundamental challenge from one of the world's leading social theorists to how we understand society and the 'social'.Bruno Latour's contention is that the word 'social', as used by Social Scientists, has become laden with assumptions to the point where it has become misnomer. When the adjective is applied to a phenomenon, it is used to indicate a stablilized state of affairs, a bundle of ties that in due course may be used to account for another phenomenon. But Latour also finds the word used as if it described a type of material, in a comparable way to an adjective such as 'wooden' or 'steely'. Rather thansimply indicating what is already assembled together, it is now used in a way that makes assumptions about the nature of what is assembled. It has become a word that designates two distinct things: a process of assembling; and a type of material, distinct from others.Latour shows why 'the social' cannot be thought of as a kind of material or domain, and disputes attempts to provide a 'social explanations' of other states of affairs. While these attempts have been productive (and probably necessary) in the past, the very success of the social sciences mean that they are largely no longer so. At the present stage it is no longer possible to inspect the precise constituents entering the social domain.Latour returns to the original meaning of 'the social' to redefine the notion, and allow it to trace connections again. It will then be possible to resume the traditional goal of the social sciences, but using more refined tools. Drawing on his extensive work examining the 'assemblages' of nature, Latour finds it necessary to scrutinize thoroughly the exact content of what is assembled under the umbrella of Society.This approach, a 'sociology of associations', has become known as Actor-Network-Theory, and this book is an essential introduction both for those seeking to understand Actor-Network Theory, or the ideas of one of its most influential proponents.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, security researchers and practitioners have tried to understand why employees do not comply with organizational security policies and mechanisms. Past re-search has treated compliance as a binary decision: people comply, or they do not. From our analysis of 118 in-depth interviews with individuals (employees in a large multinational organization) about security non-compliance, a 3rd response emerges: shadow security. This describes the instances where security-conscious employees who think they cannot comply with the prescribed security policy create a more fitting alter-native to the policies and mechanisms created by the organization’s official security staff. These workarounds are usually not visible to official security and higher management – hence ‘shadow security’. They may not be as secure as the ‘official’ policy would be in theory, but they reflect the best compromise staff can find between getting the job done and managing the risks that the assets they understand face. We conclude that rather than trying to ‘stamp out’ shadow security practices, organizations should learn from them: they provide a starting point ‘workable’ security: solutions that offer effective security and fit with the organization’s business, rather than impede it.},

Current security efforts suffer from the flawed assumption that adequate security can be provided in applications with the existing security mechanisms of mainstream operating systems.

The goal of this paper is to motivate a renewed interest in secure operating systems so that future security efforts may build on a solid foundation. This paper identifies several secure operating system features which are lacking in mainstream operating systems, argues that these features are necessary to adequately protect general application-space security mechanisms, and provides concrete examples of how current security solutions are critically dependent on these features.},

We then present {TUIs} in a broader context, survey application domains, and review frameworks and taxonomies. We also discuss conceptual foundations of {TUIs} including perspectives from cognitive sciences, psychology, and philosophy. Methods and technologies for designing, building, and evaluating {TUIs} are also addressed. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of {TUIs} and chart directions for future research.},

	title = {Coupling and Heterogeneity in Ubiquitous Computing},
	abstract = {As mobile computers' processing and communications systems become more powerful, they can support interactive tools such as collaborative virtual environments. Similarly, mixed reality systems use some of the same technologies as `traditional' collaborative virtual environments and virtual worlds, but they are increasingly coupled and interconnected with other media in a way that we usually associate with ubiquitous computing systems. The context of use of a system, and context as modelled within that system, may consist of a heterogeneous combination of both new and old media. This paper uses theoretical work on the interdependence and interpretation to discuss such coupling among heterogeneous media. Our long--term aim is better understanding of the design and use of such systems, and better design practice consistent with theory and studies of user experience.},

	abstract = {Computer science as an engineering discipline has been spectacularly successful. Yet it is also a philosophical enterprise in the way it represents the world and creates and manipulates models of reality, people, and action. In this book Paul Dourish addresses the philosophical bases of human-computer interaction. He looks at how what he calls "embodied interaction"-—an approach to interacting with software systems that emphasizes skilled, engaged practice rather than disembodied rationality—-reflects the phenomenological approaches of Martin Heidegger, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and other twentieth-century philosophers. The phenomenological tradition emphasizes the primacy of natural practice over abstract cognition in everyday activity. Dourish shows how this perspective can shed light on the foundational underpinnings of current research on embodied interaction. He looks in particular at how tangible and social approaches to interaction are related, how they can be used to analyze and understand embodied interaction, and how they could affect the design of future interactive systems.},

We get extremely detailed data on password strength, the types and lengths of passwords chosen, and how they vary by site. The data is the first large scale study of its kind, and yields numerous other insights into the role the passwords play in users' online experience.},

	shorttitle = {Discretionary Task Interleaving},
	abstract = {When participants allocated time across 2 tasks (in which they generated as many words as possible from a fixed set of letters), they made frequent switches. This allowed them to allocate more time to the more productive task (i.e., the set of letters from which more words could be generated) even though times between the last word and the switch decision (“giving-up times”) were higher in the less productive task. These findings were reliable across 2 experiments using Scrabble tasks and 1 experiment using word-search puzzles. Switch decisions appeared relatively unaffected by the ease of the competing task or by explicit information about tasks ’ potential gain. The authors propose that switch decisions reflected a dual orientation to the experimental tasks. First, there was a sensitivity to continuous rate of return—an information-foraging orientation that produced a tendency to switch in keeping with R. F. Green’s (1984) rule and a tendency to stay longer in more rewarding tasks. Second, there was a tendency to switch tasks after subgoal completion. A model combining these tendencies predicted all the reliable effects in the experimental data.},

	abstract = {Operating systems must be flexible in their support for security policies, providing sufficient mechanisms for supporting the wide variety of real-world security policies. Such flexibility requires controlling the propagation of access rights, enforcing fine-grained access rights and supporting the revocation of previously granted access rights. Previous systems are lacking in at least one of these areas. In this paper we present an operating system security architecture that solves these problems. Control over propagation is provided by ensuring that the security policy is consulted for every security decision. This control is achieved without significant performance degradation through the use of a security decision caching mechanism that ensures a consistent view of policy decisions. Both fine-grained access rights and revocation support are provided by mechanisms that are directly integrated into the service-providing components of the system. The architecture is described through its prototype implementation in the Flask microkernel-based operating system, and the policy flexibility of the prototype is evaluated. We present initial evidence that the architecture's impact on both performance and code complexity is modest. Moreover, our architecture is applicable to many other types of operating systems and environments.},

Extending the Latour-Callon model of interessement, two major activities are central for translating between viewpoints: standardization of methods, and the development of `boundary objects'. Boundary objects are both adaptable to different viewpoints and robust enough to maintain identity across them. We distinguish four types of boundary objects: repositories, ideal types, coincident boundaries and standardized forms.},

Hubert Dreyfus's commentary opens the way for a new appreciation of this difficult philosopher, revealing a rigorous and illuminating vocabulary that is indispensable for talking about the phenomenon of world.The publication of Being and Time in 1927 turned the academic world on its head. Since then it has become a touchstone for philosophers as diverse as Marcuse, Sartre, Foucault, and Derrida who seek an alternative to the rationalist Cartesian tradition of western philosophy. But Heidegger's text is notoriously dense, and his language seems to consist of unnecessarily barbaric neologisms; to the neophyte and even to those schooled in Heidegger thought, the result is often incomprehensible.Dreyfus's approach to this daunting book is straightforward and pragmatic. He explains the text by frequent examples drawn from everyday life, and he skillfully relates Heidegger's ideas to the questions about being and mind that have preoccupied a generation of cognitive scientists and philosophers of mind.Hubert L. Dreyfus is Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley.},

Unfortunately, the unauthenticated network data they interpret could well have been created by an adversary, and the helper applications are usually too complex to be bug-free. This raises significant security concerns. Therefore, it is desirable to create a secure environment to contain untrusted helper applications. We propose to reduce the risk of a security breach by restricting the program's access to the operating system. In particular, we intercept and filter dangerous system calls via the Solaris process tracing facility. This enabled us to build a simple, clean, user-mode implementation of a secure environment for untrusted helper applications. Our implementation has negligible performance impact, and can protect pre-existing applications.},

Professor Gumperz here synthesizes fundamental research on communication from a wide variety of disciplines - linguistics, sociolinguistics, anthropology and non-verbal communication - and develops an original and broadly based theory of conversational inference which shows how verbal communication can serve either between individuals of different social and ethnic backgrounds. The urgent need to overcome such barriers to effective communication is also a central concern of the book. Examples of conversational exchanges as well as of longer encounters, recorded in the urban United States, village Austria, South Asia and Britain, and analyzed to illustrate all aspects of the analytical approach, and to show how subconscious cultural presuppositions can damagingly affect interpretation of intent and judgement of interspeaker attitude. The volume will be of central interest to anyone concerned with communication, whether from a more academic viewpoint or as a professional working, for example, in the fields of interethnic or industrial relations.},

We examined work fragmentation along three dimensions: effect of collocation, type of interruption, and resumption of work. We found work to be highly fragmented: people average little time in working spheres before switching and 57\% of their working spheres are interrupted. Collocated people work longer before switching but have more interruptions. Most internal interruptions are due to personal work whereas most external interruptions are due to central work. Though most interrupted work is resumed on the same day, more than two intervening activities occur before it is. We discuss implications for technology design: how our results can be used to support people to maintain continuity within a larger framework of their working spheres.},

We explicitly emphasise the qualities of shareable use, and the importance of designing tangibles that allow for meaningful manipulation and control of the digital material. This involves a broadened focus from studying properties of the interface, to instead aim for qualities of the activity of using a system, a general tendency towards designing for social and sharable use settings and an increased openness towards multiple and subjective interpretations. An effect of this is that tangibles are not designed as representations of data, but as resources for action. We discuss four ways that tangible artefacts work as resources for action: (1) for physical manipulation; (2) for referential, social and contextually oriented action; (3) for perception and sensory experience; (4) for digitally mediated action.},

	abstract = {As users store and share more digital content at home, ac- cess control becomes increasingly important. One promis- ing approach for helping non-expert users create accurate access policies is reactive policy creation, in which users can update their policy dynamically in response to access requests that would not otherwise succeed. An earlier study suggested reactive policy creation might be a good fit for file access control at home. To test this, we conducted an experience-sampling study in which participants used a sim- ulated reactive access-control system for a week. Our results bolster the case for reactive policy creation as one mode by which home users specify access-control policy. We found both quantitative and qualitative evidence of dynamic, situ- ational policies that are hard to implement using traditional models but that reactive policy creation can facilitate. While we found some clear disadvantages to the reactive model, they do not seem insurmountable.},

We characterize intentional user activities -- interactions with the device and the applications used -- and the impact of those activities on network and energy usage. We find immense diversity among users. Along all aspects that we study, users differ by one or more orders of magnitude. For instance, the average number of interactions per day varies from 10 to 200, and the average amount of data received per day varies from 1 to 1000 {MB}. This level of diversity suggests that mechanisms to improve user experience or energy consumption will be more effective if they learn and adapt to user behavior. We find that qualitative similarities exist among users that facilitate the task of learning user behavior. For instance, the relative application popularity for can be modeled using an exponential distribution, with different distribution parameters for different users. We demonstrate the value of adapting to user behavior in the context of a mechanism to predict future energy drain. The 90th percentile error with adaptation is less than half compared to predictions based on average behavior across users.},

Networked computers are becoming ubiquitous and are playing increasingly significant roles in our lives and in the basic infrastructures of science, business, and social interaction. For human-computer interaction to advance in the new millennium we need to better understand the emerging dynamic of interaction in which the focus task is no longer confined to the desktop but reaches into a complex networked world of information and computer-mediated interactions. We think the theory of distributed cognition has a special role to play in understanding interactions between people and technologies, for its  focus has always been on whole environments: what we really do in them and how we coordinate our activity in them. Distributed cognition provides a radical reorientation of how to think about designing and supporting human-computer interaction. As a theory it is specifically tailored to understanding interactions among people and technologies. In this article we propose distributed cognition as a new foundation for human-computer interaction, sketch an integrated research framework, and use selections from our earlier work to suggest how this framework can provide new opportunities in the design of digital work materials.},

	title = {Versatility and Unix Semantics in a Fan-Out Unification File System},
	abstract = {Administrators often prefer to keep related sets of files in different locations or media, as it is easier to maintain those files separately. Users, on the other hand, prefer to see all files in one location for convenient access. One solution that accommodates both needs is a virtual unification of disparate directories—a file system that provides a merged view of several directories, without physically merging them. Unification can be used to provide copy-on-write semantics for read-only sources, merge the contents of several {CD}-{ROM} images without unpacking the images, merge binary directories from different packages, and more. It is difficult to provide a perfect illusion of a virtual unification of a set of files while maintaining Unix semantics. Past efforts to provide such unification often compromised on the set of features provided or compatibility with Unix semantics. We designed a unification file system called Unionfs which uses a promising fan-out stacking technique rarely used before. Unionfs maintains Unix semantics while offering advanced unification features such as dynamic insertion and removal of namespaces at any point in the unified view, support for any mix of read-only and read-write components, efficient in-kernel duplicate elimination, and more. We implemented a prototype of Unionfs on Linux. Our evaluation shows a 3–7 \% performance overhead for typical user-like workloads. 1},

	abstract = {Currently, application protection models are mostly static and independent. It means that the applications cannot handle multiple domains to manage accordingly the permissions for a given user request. Managing multiple domains is becoming a more and more common issue as desktop applications are growing in complexity to provide better-designed user interfaces. Today, protection systems are almost everywhere. Multiple systems of protection are available from the Linux kernel such as {SELinux} or {PIGA}-Protect to get a Mandatory Protection. Those systems provide a per-syscall validation process. Network protections are also available such as the {IPtables} firewalling mechanism. But, solutions are missing for coordinating the various mechanisms that protect different levels of the global information system. The purpose is to reuse and coordinate efficiently those different levels of protection in order to provide a end-to-end protection that manages dynamically multiple domains. Thus, the same host can support multiple domains for the user requests while providing a transparent end-to-end security that protects against complex scenarios of attack. This paper describes an attempt to deliver such a system for controlling efficiently the user requests.},

Is this simply due to a failure to apply standard user interface design techniques to security? We argue that, on the contrary, effective security requires a different usability standard, and that it will not be achieved through the user interface design techniques appropriate to other types of consumer software. To test this hypothesis, we performed a case study of a security program which does have a good user interface by general standards: {PGP} 5.0. Our case study used a cognitive walkthrough analysis together with a laboratory user test to evaluate whether {PGP} 5.0 can be successfully used by cryptography novices to achieve effective electronic mail security. The analysis found a number of user interface design flaws that may contribute to security failures, and the user test demonstrated that when our test participants were given 90 minutes in which to sign and encrypt a message using {PGP} 5.0, the majority of them were unable to do so successfully. We conclude that {PGP} 5.0 is not usable enough to provide effective security for most computer users, despite its attractive graphical user interface, supporting our hypothesis that user interface design for effective security remains an open problem. We close with a brief description of our continuing work on the development and application of user interface design principles and techniques for security.},

	abstract = {While affective computing explicitly challenges the primacy of rationality in cognitivist accounts of human activity, at a deeper level it relies on and reproduces the same information-processing model of cognition. In affective computing, affect is often seen as another kind of information - discrete units or states internal to an individual that can be transmitted in a loss-free manner from people to computational systems and back. Drawing on cultural, social, and interactional critiques of cognition which have arisen in {HCI}, we introduce and explore an alternative model of emotion as interaction: dynamic, culturally mediated, and socially constructed and experienced. This model leads to new goals for the design and evaluation of affective systems - instead of sensing and transmitting emotion, systems should support human users in understanding, interpreting, and experiencing emotion in its full complexity and ambiguity.},

We begin by unpacking some of the foundational assumptions of desktop interface design, describe an activity-based model for organizing the desktop interface based on theories of cognition and observations of real-world practice, and identify a series of high-level system requirements for interfaces that use activity as their primary organizing principle. Based on these requirements, we present the novel interface design of the Giornata system, a prototype activity-based desktop interface, and share initial findings from a longitudinal deployment of the Giornata system in a real-world setting.},

	abstract = {Theory is the bedrock of many sciences, providing a rigorous method to advance knowledge, through testing and falsifying hypotheses about observable phenomena. To begin with, the nascent field of {HCI} followed the scientific method borrowing theories from cognitive science to test theories about user performance at the interface. But {HCI} has emerged as an eclectic interdiscipline rather than a well-defined science. It now covers all aspects of human life, from birth to bereavement, through all manner of computing, from device ecologies to nano-technology. It comes as no surprise that the role of theory in {HCI} has also greatly expanded from the early days of scientific testing to include other functions such as describing, explaining, critiquing, and as the basis for generating new designs. The book charts the theoretical developments in {HCI}, both past and present, reflecting on how they have shaped the field. It explores both the rhetoric and the reality: how theories have been conceptualized, what was promised, how they have been used and which has made the most impact in the field -- and the reasons for this. Finally, it looks to the future and asks whether theory will continue to have a role, and, if so, what this might be.

Two fundamental problems were identified: (1) lack of understanding of what the policy components are (i.e. how authorization policies are structured), and (2) lack of understanding of the underlying policy paradigm (i.e. what should go into the policy, and what should be left out). Conceptual design ({CD}) techniques were used to revise the user interface ({UI}) labels so that e-Scientists and developers were better able to describe access policy components from labels, and match labels with components (t = 6.28, df = 7, p = 0.000 two-tailed). {CD}, instructional text, bubble help, {UI} behaviour and alert boxes were used to shape users' models of the policy paradigm. The final prototype improved users' efficiency and effectiveness by more than doubling the speed with which expert users could write authorization policies, and facilitating users without specialist security knowledge to overcome the policy paradigm and components problems, enabling them to complete 80\% of basic and 75\% of advanced authorization policy-writing tasks in a usability trial.},

Adding fine-grained access control improves the expressiveness, but often dramatically increases both the cost of system management and implementation complexity. Inenvironments with a more complex management model, with delegation of some management functions to parties under varying degrees of trust, the base {UNIX} model and most natural extensions are inappropriate at best. Where multiple mutually untrusting parties are introduced, ‘‘inappropriate’ ’ rapidly transitions to ‘‘nightmarish’’, especially with regards to data integrity and privacy protection. The {FreeBSD} ‘‘Jail’ ’ facility provides the ability to partition the operating system environment, while maintaining the simplicity of the {UNIX} ‘‘root’ ’ model. In Jail, users with privilege find that the scope of their requests is limited to the jail, allowing system administrators to delegate management capabilities for each virtual machine environment. Creating virtual machines in this manner has many potential uses; the most popular thus far has been for providing virtual machine services in Internet Service Provider environments. 1.},

However, deductively moving from physical context - like location - to establishing human activity has proved difficult. This paper proposes a novel approach to activity-aware computing. Instead of inferring activities, this approach enables the user to explicitly model their activity, and then use sensor-based events to create, manage, and use these computational activities adjusted to a specific context. This approach was crafted through a user-centered design process in collaboration with a hospital department. We propose three strategies for activity-awareness: context-based activity matching, context-based activity creation, and context-based activity adaptation. We present the implementation of these strategies and present an experimental evaluation of them. The experiments demonstrate that rather than considering context as information, context can be a relational property that links 'real-world activities' with their 'computational activities'.},

These systems either require users to manually create and maintain task representations or they depend on explicit user cues to guide the creation and maintenance process. To access and use the task representations in these systems, users must also specify their current task. This interaction overhead inhibits the adoption of these systems. In this paper, we present a novel approach to task management that automates the creation and maintenance of task representations. Our system supports the user by making commonly used information more "ready-at-hand" through an intuitive visualization of their task representations. Users can correct and organize their task representations by directly manipulating the visualization; however, this interaction is not required. We describe a feasibility study that demonstrates the actual utility (in terms of overhead reduction) and perceived utility of our system.},

As software design and development proceeds, the process of automation begins to expose these ill-defined situations. Therefore, although creeping requirements are troublesome, they are often a technical necessity.

Nevertheless, modern computer systems are typically single-user oriented, that is, designed to support individual tasks such as word processing while sitting at a desk. This article presents the concept of Activity-Based Computing ({ABC}), which seeks to create computational support for human activities. The {ABC} approach has been designed to address activity-based computing support for clinical work in hospitals. In a hospital, the challenges arising from the management of parallel activities and interruptions are amplified because multitasking is now combined with a high degree of mobility, collaboration, and urgency. The article presents the empirical and theoretical background for activity-based computing, its principles, the Java-based implementation of the {ABC} Framework, and an experimental evaluation together with a group of hospital clinicians. The article contributes to the growing research on support for human activities, mobility, collaboration, and context-aware computing. The {ABC} Framework presents a unifying perspective on activity-based support for human-computer interaction.},

	abstract = {User errors cause or contribute to most computer security failures, yet user interfaces for security still tend to be clumsy, confusing, or near-nonexistent. Is this simply due to a failure to apply standard user interface design techniques to security? We argue that, on the contrary, effective security requires a different usability standard, and that it will not be achieved through the user interface design techniques appropriate to other types of consumer software. To test this hypothesis, we performed a case study of a security program which does have a good user interface by general standards: {PGP} 5.0. Our case study used a cognitive walkthrough analysis together with a laboratory user test to evaluate whether {PGP} 5.0 can be successfully used by cryptography novices to achieve effective electronic mail security. The analysis found a number of user interface design flaws that may contribute to security failures, and the user test demonstrated that when our test participants were given 90 minutes in which to sign and encrypt a message using {PGP} 5.0, the majority of them were unable to do so successfully. We conclude that {PGP} 5.0 is not usable enough to provide effective security for most computer users, despite its attractive graphical user interface, supporting our hypothesis that user interface design for effective security remains an open problem. We close with a brief description of our continuing work on the development and application of user interface design principles and techniques for security.},

	abstract = {The publication in 1927 of Martin Heidegger's magnum opus, Being and Time, signaled an intellectual event of the first order and had an impact in fields far beyond that of philosophy proper. Being and Time has long been recognized as a landmark work of the twentieth century for its original analyses of the character of philosophic inquiry and the relation of the possibility of such inquiry to the human situation. Still provocative and much disputed, Heidegger's text has been taken as the inspiration for a variety of innovative movements in fields ranging from psychoanalysis, literary theory, existentialism, ethics, hermeneutics, and theology. A work that disturbs the traditions of philosophizing that it inherits, Being and Time raises questions about the end of philosophy and the possibilities for thinking liberated from the presumptions of metaphysics. The Stambaugh translation captures the vitality of the language and thinking animating Heidegger's original text. It is also the most comprehensive edition insofar as it includes the marginal notes made by Heidegger in his own copy of Being and Time, and takes account of the many changes that he made in the final German edition of 1976. The revisions to the original translation correct some ambiguities and problems that have become apparent since the translation appeared fifteen years ago. Bracketed German words have also been liberally inserted both to clarify and highlight words and connections that are difficult to translate, and to link this translation more closely to the German text.},

We present results of fieldwork observation of information workers in three different roles: analysts, software developers, and managers. We discovered that all of these types of workers experience a high level of discontinuity in the execution of their activities. People average about three minutes on a task and somewhat more than two minutes using any electronic tool or paper document before switching tasks. We introduce the concept of working spheres to explain the inherent way in which individuals conceptualize and organize their basic units of work. People worked in an average of ten different working spheres. Working spheres are also fragmented; people spend about 12 minutes in a working sphere before they switch to another. We argue that design of information technology needs to support people's continual switching between working spheres.},

	title = {Breaking our password hash habit: Why the sharing of users' password choices for defensive analysis is an underprovisioned social good, and what we can do to encourage it.},
	abstract = {Attackers only get better at guessing the passwords users will create under a given set of password-
composition constraints. They learn more about users’ password-selection behaviors each time they
compromise a passsword, regardless of whether they obtain the password by breaching a password
database, installing a key logger, phishing, or by guessing.
Defensive analysis of user-chosen passwords could similarly identify predictable password-selection
behaviors and help us to prevent users from choosing predictable passwords. Alas, attempts to perform
such analysis have been stunted by requirements to encrypt passwords irreversibly and by the indignation
shown for those who would try to analyze the passwords their users choose.
We argue that encrypting passwords irreversibly has done more harm than good, providing a minimal
short-term reduction in risk as opposed to reversible encryption, but imposing a severe cost on our
ability to improve password defenses for the long term. As encrypting passwords is of little value if
users continue to choose passwords that are easily guessed, our collective choice to blind ourselves to
our users’ passwords has made us collectively less secure. We argue that passwords should be encrypted
so as to allow for offline defensive analysis.
While we believe there’s a strong case to be made that the social benefits of defensive password
analysis outweigh the risks, the individual cost/benefit tradeoff discourages users and firms from con-
tributing passwords for defensive analysis. When choosing a password, an individual may benefit from
analyses based on others’ prior contributions, but does not benefit from contributing the password she
chooses. However, she bears the risk should the password she has chosen is compromised as a result of
contributing. This makes making free-riding on others’ password contributions the security-optimizing
strategy for her as an individual. To solve this free rider problem, we propose that systems that help to
prevent users from choosing weak passwords (informed by prior users’ passwords choices), require that those using the system contribute their newly-hosen passwords in return.},

Drawing on the pragmatism of such philosophers as John Dewey and Mikhail Bakhtin, they provide a framework for a clearer analysis of technology as experience.Just as Dewey, in Art as Experience, argued that art is part of everyday lived experience and not isolated in a museum, {McCarthy} and Wright show how technology is deeply embedded in everyday life. The "zestful integration" or transcendent nature of the aesthetic experience, they say, is a model of what human experience with technology might become.{McCarthy} and Wright illustrate their theoretical framework with real-world examples that range from online shopping to ambulance dispatch. Their approach to understanding human computer interaction—seeing it as creative, open, and relational, part of felt experience—is a measure of the fullness of technology's potential to be more than merely functional.},

Stuxnet was a powerful targeted cyber-attack, and soon other malware samples were discovered that belong to this family. In this paper, we will first present our analysis of Duqu, an information-collecting malware sharing striking similarities with Stuxnet. Wedescribe our contributions in the investigation ranging from the original detection of Duquvia finding the dropper file to the design of a Duqu detector toolkit. We then continue with the analysis of the Flame advanced information-gathering malware. Flame is unique in thesense that it used advanced cryptographic techniques to masquerade as a legitimate proxyfor the Windows Update service. We also present the newest member of the family, called Gauss, whose unique feature is that one of its modules is encrypted such that it can onlybe decrypted on its target system; hence, the research community has not yet been able to analyze this module. For this particular malware, we designed a Gauss detector serviceand we are currently collecting intelligence information to be able to break its very specialencryption mechanism. Besides explaining the operation of these pieces of malware, wealso examine if and how they could have been detected by vigilant system administrators manually or in a semi-automated manner using available tools. Finally, we discuss lessonsthat the community can learn from these incidents. We focus on technical issues, and avoidspeculations on the origin of these threats and other geopolitical questions.},

Currently, people in these roles have no technological tools to guide the creation of clear and implementable high-quality privacy policy rules. High-quality privacy rules can be the basis for verifiable automated privacy access decisions. An empirical study was conducted with 36 users who were novices in privacy policy authoring to evaluate the quality of rules created and user satisfaction with two experimental privacy authoring tools and a control condition. Results show that users presented with scenarios were able to author significantly higher quality rules using either the natural language with a privacy rule guide tool or a structured list tool as compared to an unguided natural language control condition. The significant differences in quality were found in both user self-ratings of rule quality and objective quality scores. Users ranked the two experimental tools significantly higher than the control condition. Implications of the research and future research directions are discussed.},

We show how to break the security of one published {IDS} with these methods, and we experimentally confirm the power of mimicry attacks by giving a worked example of an attack on a concrete {IDS} implementation.

	abstract = {Enterprises today face a daunting task of enforcing desktop standardization. This challenge is intensified since the majority of users run as local administrators on their computers. As a local administrator, a user can install and uninstall applications and adjust system and security settings at will. As a result, {IT} departments often cannot gauge the holistic health and security of their environments. In addition, every application that these users launch can potentially use their accounts’ administrative-level access to write to system files and the registry and to modify system-wide data. Common tasks like browsing the Web and checking e-mail can become unsafe in this scenario. In addition, all of these elements increase an organization’s total cost of ownership ({TCO}).

{IT} departments must be given a solution that is both resilient to attack and protective of data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. For this reason, the Windows Vista® development team chose to redesign the way that the Windows core security infrastructure and applications interact. User Account Control ({UAC}) was the outcome of this redesign process.},

At the end of program execution, the user can examine changes in the sandbox filesystem and selectively commit them back to the host filesystem. {MBOX} implements this by interposing on system calls and provides a variety of useful applications: installing system packages as a non-root user, running unknown binaries safely without network accesses, checkpointing the host filesystem instantly, and setting up a virtual development environment without special tools. Our performance evaluation shows that {MBOX} imposes {CPU} overheads of 0.1-45.2\% for various workloads. In this paper, we present {MBOX}'s design, efficient techniques for interposing on system calls, our experience avoiding common system call interposition pitfalls, and {MBOX}'s performance evaluation.},

	abstract = {{HCI} research published 10 years ago pointed out that many users cannot cope with the number and complexity of passwords, and resort to insecure workarounds as a consequence. We present a study which re-examined password policies and password practice in the workplace today. 32 staff members in two organisations kept a password diary for 1 week, which produced a sample of 196 passwords. The diary was followed by an interview which covered details of each password, in its context of use. We find that users are in general concerned to maintain security, but that existing security policies are too inflexible to match their capabilities, and the tasks and contexts in which they operate. As a result, these password policies can place demands on users which impact negatively on their productivity and, ultimately, that of the organisation. We conclude that, rather than focussing password policies on maximizing password strength and enforcing frequency alone, policies should be designed using {HCI} principles to help the user to set an appropriately strong password in a specific context of use.},

During our field study, users continued through a tenth of Mozilla Firefox's malware and phishing warnings, a quarter of Google Chrome's malware and phishing warnings, and a third of Mozilla Firefox's {SSL} warnings. This demonstrates that security warnings can be effective in practice; security experts and system architects should not dismiss the goal of communicating security information to end users. We also find that user behavior varies across warnings. In contrast to the other warnings, users continued through 70.2\% of Google Chrome's {SSL} warnings. This indicates that the user experience of a warning can have a significant impact on user behavior. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for warning designers and researchers.},

Even though they are convenient for implementers, for users they are increasingly unmanageable. The demands placed on users (passwords that are unguessable, all different, regularly changed and never written down) are no longer reasonable now that each person has to manage dozens of passwords. Yet we can't abandon passwords until we come up with an alternative method of user authentication that is both usable and secure. We present an alternative design based on a hardware token called Pico that relieves the user from having to remember passwords and {PINs}. Unlike most alternatives, Pico doesn't merely address the case of web passwords: it also applies to all the other contexts in which users must at present remember passwords, passphrases and {PINs}. Besides relieving the user from memorization efforts, the Pico solution scales to thousands of credentials, provides "continuous authentication" and is resistant to brute force guessing, dictionary attacks, phishing and keylogging.},

	abstract = {This tutorial paper explores the mechanics of protecting computer-stored information from unauthorized use or modification. It concentrates on those architectural structures--whether hardware or software--that are necessary to support information protection. The paper develops in three main sections. Section I describes desired functions, design principles, and examples of elementary protection and authentication mechanisms. Any reader familiar with computers should find the first section to be reasonably accessible. Section {II} requires some familiarity with descriptor-based computer architecture. It examines in depth the principles of modern protection architectures and the relation between capability systems and access control list systems, and ends with a brief analysis of protected subsystems and protected objects. The reader who is dismayed by either the prerequisites or the level of detail in the second section may wish to skip to Section {III}, which reviews the state of the art and current research projects and provides suggestions for further reading. Glossary The following glossary provides, for reference, brief definitions for several terms as used in this paper in the context of protecting information in computers. Access The ability to make use of information stored in a computer system. Used frequently as a verb, to the horror of grammarians. Access control list A list of principals that are authorized to have access to some object. Authenticate To verify the identity of a person (or other agent external to the protection system) making a request.},

The shaping of digital artifacts is a design process that influences the form and functions of workplaces, schools, communication, and culture; the successful interaction designer must use both ethical and aesthetic judgment to create designs that are appropriate to a given environment. This book is not a how-to manual, but a collection of tools for thought about interaction design.Working with information technology -- called by the authors "the material without qualities" -- interaction designers create not a static object but a dynamic pattern of interactivity. The design vision is closely linked to context and not simply focused on the technology. The authors' action-oriented and context-dependent design theory, drawing on design theorist Donald Schon's concept of the reflective practitioner, helps designers deal with complex design challenges created by new technology and new knowledge. Their approach, based on a foundation of thoughtfulness that acknowledges the designer's responsibility not only for the functional qualities of the design product but for the ethical and aesthetic qualities as well, fills the need for a theory of interaction design that can increase and nurture design knowledge. From this perspective they address the fundamental question of what kind of knowledge an aspiring designer needs, discussing the process of design, the designer, design methods and techniques, the design product and its qualities, and conditions for interaction design."},

	abstract = {The implementation of usable security is particularly challenging in the growing field of Grid computing, where control is decentralised, systems are heterogeneous, and authorization applies across administrative domains. {PERMIS}, based on the Role-Based Access Control ({RBAC}) model, provides a unified infrastructure to address these challenges. Previous research has found that resource owners who do not understand the {PERMIS} {RBAC} model have difficulty expressing access control policies. We have addressed this issue by investigating the use of a controlled natural language parser for expressing these policies. In this paper, we describe our experiences in the design, implementation, and evaluation of this parser for the {PERMIS} Editor. We began by understanding Grid access control needs as expressed by resource owners, through interviews and focus groups with 45 Grid practitioners. We found that the many areas of Grid computing use present varied security requirements; this suggests a minimal, open design. We designed and implemented a controlled natural language system to support these needs, which we evaluated with a cross-section of 17 target users. We found that participants were not daunted by the text editor, and understood the syntax easily. However, some strict requirements of the controlled language were problematic. Using controlled natural language helps overcome some conceptual mis-matches between {PERMIS} {RBAC} and older paradigms; however, there are still subtleties which are not always understood. In conclusion, the parser is not sufficient on its own, and should be seen in the interplay with other parts of the {PERMIS} Editor, so that, iteratively, users are helped to understand the underlying {PERMIS} model and to express their security policies more accurately and more completely.},

We conducted three between-subjects experiments to test the effectiveness of the attractors. In the first two experiments, we sent participants to perform a task on what appeared to be a third-party site that required installation of a browser plugin. We presented them with what appeared to be an installation dialog from their operating system. Participants who saw dialogs that employed inhibitive attractors were significantly less likely than those in the control group to ignore clues that installing this software might be harmful. In the third experiment, we attempted to habituate participants to dialogs that they knew were part of the experiment. We used attractors to highlight a field that was of no value during habituation trials and contained critical information after the habituation period. Participants exposed to inhibitive attractors were two to three times more likely to make an informed decision than those in the control condition.},

Target security policies derived from functional specifications select permitted causalities. Security mecha- nisms extract features from causes and effects and enforce mechanism-specific policies, approximating the target pol- icy. Advantages of the classifier paradigm are the ability to generalize from incomplete information and examples, to measure classification error and mechanism performance, and to analyze mechanism ensembles and compositions. The classifier paradigm also offers a conception of problem com- plexity and suggests paying more attention to the impact of mechanisms rather than to their inner workings.},

Security warnings are one key strategy for trying to warn users about those threats; but recently, it has been questioned whether they are effective. We conducted a study in which 120 participants brought their own laptops to a usability test of a new academic article summary tool. They encountered a {PDF} download warning for one of the papers. All participants noticed the warning, but 98 (81.7\%) downloaded the {PDF} file that triggered it. There was no significant difference between responses to a brief generic warning, and a longer specific one. The participants who heeded the warning were overwhelmingly female, and either had previous experience with viruses or a low level of computing skills. Our analysis of the reasons for ignoring warnings shows that participants have become desensitised by frequent exposure and false alarms, and think they can recognise security risks. At the same time, their answers revealed some misunderstandings about security threats: for instance, they rely on anti-virus software to protect them from a wide range of threats, and do not believe that {PDF} files can infect their machine with viruses. We conclude that security warnings in their current forms are largely ineffective, and will remain so, unless the number of false positives can be reduced.},

We present a study of 118 individual's experiences of authorization measures in a multi-national company and their self-reported subsequent behavior. We follow the recent advances in applying economic models to security usability and analyze the interrelations of authorization issues with individuals' behaviors and organizational goals. Our results indicate that authorization problems significantly impact the productivity and effective security of organizations. From the data, we derive authorization Personas and their daily problems, which are to a large extent caused by the procedures for policy changes and the decision-making, and lead to the circumvention of the measure. As one research contribution, we develop a holistic model of authorization problems. More practically, we recommend to monitor non-compliance, such as password-sharing, for indications of authorization problems, and to establish light-weight procedures for policy changes with adequate degrees of centralization and formalization, and support for decision-making.},

In this paper, we introduce a new approach to security-related dialogs called Adaptive Security Dialogs ({ASD}). This approach is a combination of a new architecture and a new way of interacting with users to provide them with appropriate and effective security dialogs. {ASD} realizes this goal by matching the complexity and intrusiveness of security-related dialogs to the risk associated with the decision the user is making. This results in an architecture in which users can focus on their tasks, get (immediate) feedback on their decisions, and interact with dialogs with an appropriate complexity and appearance for the decision's associated risk. This paper makes the following three contributions. First, we introduce a general architecture for handling security-related decisions. Second, through an empirical user study using a web-based e-mail client, we show significant improvement in the care exercised by our participants without sacrificing usability. Third, we describe how the different pieces of existing research fit into the bigger picture of improving users' behavior.},

	abstract = {A user interface software tool helps developers design and implement the user interface. Research on past tools has had enormous impact on today's developers—virtually all applications today are built using some form of user interface tool. In this article, we consider cases of both success and failure in past user interface tools. From these cases we extract a set of themes which can serve as lessons for future work. Using these themes, past tools can be characterized by what aspects of the user interface they addressed, their threshold and ceiling, what path of least resistance they offer, how predictable they are to use, and whether they addressed a target that became irrelevant. We believe the lessons of these past themes are particularly important now, because increasingly  rapid technological changes are likely to significantly change user interfaces. We are at the dawn of an era where user interfaces are about to break out of the “desktop” box where they have been stuck for the past 15 years. The next millenium will open with an increasing diversity of user interface on an increasing diversity of computerized devices. These devices include hand-held personal digital assistants ({PDAs}), cell phones, pages, computerized pens, computerized notepads, and various kinds of desk and wall size-computers, as well as devices in everyday objects (such as mounted on refridgerators, or even embedded in truck tires). The increased connectivity of computers, initially evidenced by the World Wide Web, but spreading also with technologies such as personal-area  networks, will also have a profound effect on the user interface to computers. Another important force will be recognition-based user interfaces, especially speech, and camera-based vision systems. Other changes we see are an increasing need for 3D and end-user customization, programming, and scripting. All of these changes will require significant support from the underlying user interface sofware tools.},

Even when applying ethnographic methods, it is difficult to capture the ephemerality and prototypicality of cooperative work that Grudin claims must be preserved through design. Through a discussion of a design project dedicated to the design of support for social awareness, we reflect on the means of design - scenarios and prototypes, and their ability to support design for ephemerality and prototypicality. Our conclusion is that by using scenarios as boundary objects, in multiple prototyping experiments, they support the negotiation and boundary understanding of design ideas, rather than one or more solutions. Hence it becomes possible to design to preserve ephemerality and prototypicality.},

	url = {http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:gbv:46-00102681-14},
	abstract = {Restrictions and permissions in information systems – Authorization – can cause problems for those interacting with the systems. Often, the problems materialize as an interference with the primary tasks, for example, when restrictions prevent the efficient completing of work and cause frustration. Problems are not only caused by restrictive permissions, though, but also by permissive ones, for example, from permissions that remain assigned. In this case, the security measure becomes inef- fective. Conversely, its effectiveness can also be impacted when staff is forced to circumvent the measure to complete work – typically sharing passwords among each other. This is the perspective of functional staff and the organization. There are further perspectives in- volved in the administration and development of the authorization measure. For instance, functional staff need to interact with policy makers who decide on the granting of additional permissions, and policy makers, in turn, interact with policy authors who actually implement changes. If the proce- dures of the interactions or the activities themselves incur high effort, the authorization measure will be inefficient. Similarly, developers implement the technical authorization mechanisms, and need to interact with other stakeholders to take their problems into account to arrive at usable mechanisms. To unravel this entanglement of problems and their interrelation, this thesis analyzes the diverse contexts in which authorization occurs, limits the scope to organizational environments, and system- atically examines the problems that surround the different perspectives on authorization in organi- zational settings, deriving requirements and open research questions. Based on prior research and original research in secure agile development, eight principles to address the authorization problems are identified and explored through practical artifacts. The Authorization Principles aim to foster the participation and interaction among involved and affected stakeholders, including reducing the burden and making the abstract aspects of authorization understandable by increasing the concreteness. Moreover, the mitigations explicitly aim to integrate approaches from diverse disciplines, going beyond the currently predominant technical approaches, for example, by applying socio-organizational approaches. Particularly, the behavior of individuals in their social setting should be accounted for, and the security awareness and expertise of the in- volved individuals should be increased. To better cope with the dynamics surrounding authorization, it is also suggested to design the measures for dynamics and generally aim to tailor for the context regarding procedures (formality, centralization) and tools (flexibility, individuals’ expertise). Applying the principles in the practical artifacts and drawing on the respective empirical evalua- tions, the principles show to be useful in improving authorization measures, even though the degree of usefulness strongly depends on the context of use. The thesis concludes by proposing to apply the principles and its main theme – broadening security usability to the organizational – to other areas of information security: fostering the participation between and integration of perspectives on the security measure, and opening information security research further to interdisciplinarity.},

We argue that simply blaming users will not lead to more effective security systems. Security designers must identify the causes of undesirable user behaviour, and address these to design effective security systems. We present examples of how undesirable user behaviour with passwords can be caused by failure to recognise the characteristics of human memory, unattainable or conflicting task demands, and lack of support, training and motivation. We conclude that existing human/computer interaction knowledge and techniques can be used to prevent or address these problems, and outline a vision of a holistic design approach for usable and effective security.},

We propose a set of guidelines to aid platform designers in determining the most appropriate permission-granting mechanism for a given permission. We apply our proposal to a smart-phone platform.

	abstract = {Modern client platforms, such as {iOS}, Android, Windows Phone, Windows 8, and web browsers, run each application in an isolated environment with limited privileges. A pressing open problem in such systems is how to allow users to grant applications access to user-owned resources, e.g., to privacy- and cost-sensitive devices like the camera or to user data residing in other applications. A key challenge is to enable such access in a way that is non-disruptive to users while still maintaining least-privilege restrictions on applications. In this paper, we take the approach of user-driven access control, whereby permission granting is built into existing user actions in the context of an application, rather than added as an afterthought via manifests or system prompts. To allow the system to precisely capture permission-granting intent in an application's context, we introduce access control gadgets ({ACGs}). Each user-owned resource exposes {ACGs} for applications to embed. The user's authentic {UI} interactions with an {ACG} grant the application permission to access the corresponding resource. Our prototyping and evaluation experience indicates that user-driven access control is a promising direction for enabling in-context, non-disruptive, and least-privilege permission granting on modern client platforms.},

As a number of sociologists and philosophers have pointed out, past social interaction, as well as past use of the heterogeneous mix of media, tools and artifacts that we use in our everyday activity, influence our ongoing interaction with the people and media at hand. We suggest that one's experience and history is thus part of one's current context, with patterns of use temporally and subjectively combining and interconnecting different media as well as different modes of use of those media. One such mode of use is transparent use, put forward by Weiser as ubicomp's design ideal. One theoretical finding is that this design ideal is unachievable or incomplete because transparent and more focused analytical use are interdependent, affecting and feeding into each other through one's experience and history. Using these theoretical points, we discuss a number of context-aware system designs that make good use of history in supporting ongoing user activity.},

	abstract = {Multitasking is the result of time allocation decisions made by individuals faced with multiple tasks. Multitasking research is important in order to improve the design of systems and applications. Since people typically use computers to perform multiple tasks at the same time, insights into this type of behavior can help develop better systems and ideal types of computer environments for modern multitasking users. In this paper, we define multitasking based on the principles of task independence and performance concurrency and develop a set of metrics for computer-based multitasking. The theoretical foundation of this metric development effort stems from an application of key principles of Activity Theory and a systematic analysis of computer usage from the perspective of the user, the task and the technology. The proposed metrics, which range from a lean dichotomous variable to a richer measure based on switches, were validated with data from a sample of users who self-reported their activities during a computer usage session. This set of metrics can be used to establish a conceptual and methodological foundation for future multitasking studies.},

	abstract = {Embodiment has become an important concept in many
areas of cognitive science. There are, however, very
different notions of exactly what embodiment is and
what kind of body is required for what type of embodied
cognition. Hence, while many nowadays would agree
that humans are embodied cognizers, there is much less
agreement on what kind of artifact could be considered
embodied. This paper identifies and contrasts six
different notions of embodiment which can roughly be
characterized as (1) structural coupling between agent
and environment, (2) historical embodiment as the result
of a history of struct ural coupling, (3) physical
embodiment, (4) organismoid embodiment, i.e. organismlike
bodily form (e.g., humanoid robots), (5) organismic
embodiment of autopoietic, living systems, and (6) social
embodiment.},

	abstract = {Intelligibility is one of the key factors affecting the acceptance and effective use of information systems. In this article, we discuss the ways in which recognition of this factor challenges current system design strategies, as well as current theoretical perspectives and research methodologies. In particular, we claim that in order to understand the problem of system intelligibility, we must focus not only on the cognitive, but also on the social aspects of system use. After considering some of the sources of users' difficulty in understanding information systems, we propose a new global philosophy for interface design: design for the management of trouble. We discuss the design implications of four mechanisms for improving system intelligibility: (1) useful mental models of the system and its associated subsystems, (2) communicative repair in user-system interaction, (3) new training strategies, and (4) use of the larger social environment as an aid to understanding information systems. We then discuss the possibility of developing intelligent systems capable of providing assistance and feedback related specifically to users' actions. We claim that development of such systems requires understanding the mechanisms for achieving mutual intelligibility in interaction and propose new research approaches for investigating these mechanisms. In the final section, we elaborate on the relationship between information systems and the larger social environment, suggesting that the functionality and design of information systems can deeply influence the surrounding culture. We propose adopting a goal of socially proactive design and discuss the possibilities for embedding new paradigms for communication and problem solving in specialized information systems.},

	abstract = {Software vulnerabilities have had a devastating effect on the Internet. Worms such as {CodeRed} and Slammer can compromise hundreds of thousands of hosts within hours or even minutes, and cause millions of dollars of damage [26, 43]. To successfully combat these fast automatic Internet attacks, we need fast automatic attack detection and filtering mechanisms. In this paper we propose dynamic taint analysis for automatic detection of overwrite attacks, which include most types of exploits. This approach does not need source code or special compilation for the monitored program, and hence works on commodity software. To demonstrate this idea, we have implemented {TaintCheck}, a mechanism that can perform dynamic taint analysis by performing binary rewriting at run time. We show that {TaintCheck} reliably detects most types of exploits. We found that {TaintCheck} produced no false positives for any of the many different programs that we tested. Further, we describe how {TaintCheck} could improve automatic signature generation in several ways.},

We conducted a survey of over 400 Internet users to examine their reactions to and understanding of current {SSL} warnings. We then designed two new warnings using warnings science principles and lessons learned from the survey. We evaluated warnings used in three popular web browsers and our two warnings in a 100- participant, between-subjects laboratory study. Our warnings performed significantly better than existing warnings, but far too many participants exhibited dangerous behavior in all warning conditions. Our results suggest that, while warnings can be improved, a better approach may be to minimize the use of {SSL} warnings altogether by blocking users from making unsafe connections and eliminating warnings in benign situations.},

This is partly due to a lack of agreement on the essential characteristics of {UX}. In this paper, we present the results of our multi-year effort of collecting {UX} evaluation methods from academia and industry with different approaches such as literature review, workshops, Special Interest Groups sessions and an online survey. We have collected 96 methods and analyzed them, among other criteria, based on the product development phase and the studied period of experience. Our analysis reveals development needs for {UX} evaluation methods, such as early-stage methods, methods for social and collaborative {UX} evaluation, establishing practicability and scientific quality, and a deeper understanding of {UX}.},

Traditionally, {HCI} has taken place within a constrained and well-understood domain of experience—single users sitting at desks and interacting with conventionally-designed computers employing screens, keyboards and mice for interaction. New opportunities have engendered considerable interest in “context-aware computing”—computational systems that can sense and respond to aspects of the settings in which they are used. However, considerable confusion surrounds the notion of “context”—what it means, what it includes and what role it plays in interactive systems. This paper suggests that the representational stance implied by conventional interpretations of “context” misinterprets the role of context in everyday human activity, and proposes an alternative model that suggests different directions for design.},

Alas, these alternatives rarely provide the same level of confidentiality, integrity, or auditability pro- vided by the prescribed file systems. Thus, the imposition of restrictive mechanisms and policies by system designers and administrators may actually reduce the system’s secu- rity. We observe that the failure modes of file systems that en- force centrally-imposed access control policies are similar to the failure modes of centrally-planned economies: individu- als either learn to circumvent these restrictions as matters of necessity or desert the system entirely, subverting the goals behind the central policy. We formalize requirements for laissez-faire sharing, which parallel the requirements of free market economies, to bet- ter address the file sharing needs of information workers. Because individuals are less likely to feel compelled to cir- cumvent systems that meet these laissez-faire requirements, such systems have the potential to increase both productiv- ity and security.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this commentary article is to present critical analysis of the term 'engagement' which some scientists attempt to introduce to the activity theory. Presented commentary demonstrates that the term 'engagement' is redundant because activity theory utilizes the concept of task instead of engagement. In activity theory the task is considered as logically organised system of cognitive and behavioural actions oriented toward a particular goal of task. The task always involves goal achievement that assumes motivational components.},

Asking, and consequently answering questions, however, never occurs in a vacuum. Rather, it occurs in a specific social and cognitive context that may influence responses in undesired ways (e.g., Schuman \& Presser, 1981). Thus, a change in the answer to a particular question may not necessarily reflect an attitude change on the part of the respondent but simply may be the influence of a different context. Schuman, Presser, and Ludwig (1981), for example, found that divergent responses toward abortion, as measured in two consecutive surveys, were caused not by a change of opinion over time but by the presence or absence of a particular question before the target question.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a study of an organisation, which is undergoing a process transforming organisational and technological boundaries. In particular, we shall look at three kinds of boundaries: the work to maintain and change the boundary between the organisation and its customers; boundaries between competencies within the organisation; and boundaries between various physical locations of work, in particular between what is done in the office and what is done on site. Maintaining and changing boundaries are the processes through which a particular community sustains its identity and practice on the one hand, and where it is confronted with the identity and practices on the other.The organisation being studied employs a multitude of {IT} systems that support and maintain these boundaries in a particular manner that are in many ways inappropriate to the current needs of the organisation.After analysing the history and the current boundary work, the paper will propose new technological support for boundary work. In particular the paper will suggest means of supporting boundaries when these are productive and for changing boundaries when this seems more appropriate. In total, flexible technologies seem a core issue when dealing with technology for boundaries.},

As a first step towards solving this problem, we present some preliminary findings from a study currently under way, which seeks to investigate the mental models and conceptual arrangements by which people understand the problems of everyday security.},
